## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Working on this was really good. I have leared how to use CSS grid, and practiced its properties. Also, I have learned how write cleaner code. I also learn some best practices for styling button and anchor elements like that I have to give the focus a thought too. In addition, I had the chance to try few CSS selector that I learned.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
   <div class="subscription">
            <h3>Monthly subscription</h3>
            <div class="offer">
                <div class="price"><span
                class="dollars">$29</span><span
                class="per-month">per month</span>
                <div>
                <p>Full access for less than 
                  day</p>
            </div>
            <button>Sign Up</button>
        </div>
```
```css
.community{
    background-color: var(--white);
    border-radius: 5px 5px 0 0;
    display: grid;
    gap: 1.5rem;
} 
/* first time using grid */

```
### Continued development

Currently I'm learning JavaScript as soon as I get a hang of it a bit I have an Idea of adding some actions to the button when clicked maybe a popup window or something.


### Useful resources

- [Elzero web school](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWXRXgPf3t4Qav8ha0fQ0hw8gN41hSSFn) - These videos are the best to understand Grid CSS or anything related to web developement.
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_selectors.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS selectors. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
